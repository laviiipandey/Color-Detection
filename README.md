# Color-Detection
This project uses the cv2 library to detect specific colors in an image by converting it to the HSV color space. numpy is used for efficient numerical operations, and pandas helps in managing and analyzing detected color data. The project identifies and isolates colors for applications in image processing and computer vision.
